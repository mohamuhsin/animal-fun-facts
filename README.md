# animal fun facts

In this project, we’ll build a program that allows users to click an animal on the screen in order to have a fun fact pop up.

# Tasks

**1.** On line 1 in app.js, you should see an import statement. This is importing the animals object from animals.js. Feel free to take a look at it now, but we’ll be coming back to it in later tasks.

For now, let’s import the React from react and createRoot from react-dom/client.

**2.** Click on index.html to find out the id of the HTML element to get a reference of. Use this id and the document object to get a reference of this element and store it in a constant called container.

**3.** Create a React root so you can render content using the createRoot() method, passing container as an argument. Store this root in a constant called root.
